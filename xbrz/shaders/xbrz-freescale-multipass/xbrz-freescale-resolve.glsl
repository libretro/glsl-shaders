// xBRZ freescale, multipass: xBRZ at any scale factor, in three passes.
//
// Rules 2 and 4 to 7 below keep xBRZ from cutting corners into shapes the artist did not draw
// (fake diagonals at junctions of three colors, bent frames, rounded ends of stripes). They are
// on by default; XBRZ_DIAG = 0 turns them off, for the reference xBRZ shapes. Rules 1, 3 and 8 to
// 13 are the crisp look and run with XBRZ_MINC above 0; the xbrz-crisp preset sets it to 20, so
// low-contrast shading and textures keep their pixels.
//
// xBRZ decides, for each corner of each pixel, whether to cut it and how (a corner piece, a 45-degree
// line, or a shallow or steep line). The rules below then change some of those decisions. Each rule
// has a section of the same number and name in the code. The first pass (pass 0) makes the decisions,
// the resolve pass, also once per game pixel, finishes rules 1, 2 and 9, which need the neighbours'
// decisions, and the output pass (pass 1) only draws the corners.
//
// 1. Minimum contrast (XBRZ_MINC): a corner whose two colors differ by less than XBRZ_MINC (x/255,
//    YCbCr distance) is left square, so low-contrast shading, dithering and textures (grass,
//    foliage, stone) keep their pixel detail, while outlines, text and sprites are smoothed as in
//    xBRZ. A corner up to 4 below the limit is weak: it is still rounded when the same corner of both
//    neighbours along its cut is rounded, so a diagonal edge has no tooth where its contrast dips.
// 2. Diagonal limit (XBRZ_DIAG): a corner is blocked when the two colors on its diagonal (the colors
//    the cut would join) differ by more than XBRZ_DIAG, so a junction of three different colors is
//    not pulled into a fake diagonal (an idea from torcado's cleanEdge, MIT license).
//    Antialiasing ramps, where one of those colors sits between the pixel and the other one, use 92.
//    A corner is not blocked:
//    - on a shallow or steep line, unless it would cut a pixel with a lighter color, so dark
//      outlines, eyes and eyebrows keep their pixels;
//    - at the tip of a 1-pixel diagonal stripe, so the stripe runs on to the edge;
//    - between two close inner tones next to an outline darker than both, so the cut runs up to the
//      outline, which stays whole (not at the corner of a solid block, along a 1-pixel stripe or next
//      to a corner the artist already rounded with an antialiasing pixel).
//    A blocked corner whose blend color runs straight on, like a frame or a horizontal line, stays
//    square, so lines do not bend where they meet. Any other blocked corner is cut by the resolve pass
//    only where it continues a cut: when a neighbour on the same diagonal is cut, so lines are drawn
//    to the end, or when the neighbour across its edge cuts the other end of that edge with a line in
//    the pixel's color, so the two cuts make one diagonal that ends on a straight edge, like the tip
//    of a lock of hair (that line may also run toward the pixel diagonal to E when it has E's color,
//    so a thin arm closes up to the next color).
// 3. Eye: where two dark strokes of different colors meet in an L around a 1-pixel light gap, like
//    a pupil under an eyebrow, the corner stays square.
// 4. Diagonal up to the wall: a corner changed by rules 2 and 3 comes back as in xBRZ where the
//    pixel's color runs on as a 45-degree diagonal along the cut up to a straight line, like hair or
//    a fence post, unless that would bend a straight line or stretch a lone 1-pixel dot.
// 5. Thin light stroke: it also comes back where a 1-pixel stroke lighter than both colors runs on
//    along the cut, like the white strokes of letters.
// 6. Antialiasing notch: and where a single antialiasing pixel steps along a diagonal edge between
//    two colors, like the shaded edge of a cape.
// 7. Stripe ends: where a stack of 1- or 2-pixel stripes of different colors ends flush, like the
//    bars of a gauge or a striped wall, the end corners stay square when their diagonal colors differ
//    by more than 36, so every stripe ends the same way. A line that turns diagonal at its end is
//    not a stripe end. A stripe only 3 pixels long is left alone when the color past its end
//    runs straight on, like a line meeting it. Nor is a pixel whose side neighbour is a close tone of
//    it, where the end corner is a line between two outline colors darker than it, like a dark outline
//    turning diagonal over a forehead.
// 8. Line through an antialiasing pixel: when a line cuts one corner of a pixel whose color lies
//    between the line's two colors on a strong edge, and rule 1 left the opposite corner square, that
//    corner is cut too, as in xBRZ, so the pixel becomes a thin strip of the diagonal instead of a
//    notch in it.
// 9. Line shapes: the shallow and steep line tests weigh hue a little more than lightness (1.2x), so
//    lines in hue-shifted shading follow the artist's pixels. A line xBRZ finds is kept too, unless it
//    would bring back a corner blocked by rule 2 or the line's color runs on along a 45-degree
//    diagonal in the same color. Where a line found only by the hue weighting, between two
//    different colors, would run into the line of the neighbour across the same edge, it is drawn
//    as in xBRZ. A line found only by the hue weighting is not drawn where the pixel at its far end is
//    closer to the pixel's own color than to the line's, so a diagonal of that color is not cut short
//    (Goku's brow in Buu's Fury), nor where its two colors clearly differ and the line's color runs on
//    along a 45-degree diagonal in the same color (the tip of Goku's nose).
// 10. Pixel closed between outlines: a pixel closed in a straight row between two pixels of a
//     near-black outline that also wraps the corner, like the brown brow between the black lines of
//     Link's eye, is not pulled toward E by a line through the outline; that corner stays square.
// 11. Lines in a larger window: a corner that rule 1 left square is still cut as in xBRZ where it lies
//     on a straight line (45 degrees or 2:1, with regular steps) between two stripes that run on for
//     5 pixels or more, one of them 1 pixel wide against a strong contour, like the inner side of an
//     outline's antialiasing band or the stripes of a bar, so those lines have no teeth.
// 12. Closed shadow: where a near-black shadow runs under an object, like the round shadow under a
//     character's feet, the background pixel in the notch between them gets a wedge of the shadow's
//     color and the shadow's corners next to the notch stay square, so the shadow's outline closes.
//     The shape is read in a 7x7 window (an arm 3 pixels long with background outside it, a solid
//     2x2 lobe, an object bigger than 1 pixel), so serifs, letters and textures are left alone.
//     The floor around the notch may have any color or texture (grass, tiles): it only has to be
//     lighter than the shadow and differ from both the shadow and the object.
// 13. Tiles between walls: in a row of 1-pixel tiles (4 or more, in a repeating pattern) that runs
//     between two straight walls, like the squares of a gauge, a blocked corner between two tiles
//     stays square, so no diagonal is chained through the row.
// XBRZ_DIAG = 0 turns rules 2 to 7, 9, 10, 12 and 13 off, and XBRZ_MINC = 0 turns rules 1, 3 and 8 to
// 13 off, so with XBRZ_MINC at 0 only rules 2 and 4 to 7 run.
//
// The first pass makes every blend decision once per input pixel (blend type, line type, blend
// color and the minimum contrast) and the resolve pass, also once per input pixel, settles the
// ones that depend on the neighbours' decisions, so the output pass, which runs once per output
// pixel, only reads two textures where no corner is cut. Blend color ties and the order of the
// four corners follow the reference C++ xBRZ, and the output pass reads the image from the pass
// before xBRZ, so it also works after other shaders in a preset.
// Defaults: equal color tolerance 15, dominant direction 3.8, steep/shallow line 3.2
// (reference xBRZ: 30, 3.6 and 2.2).
